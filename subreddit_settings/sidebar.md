#**Advent of Code**

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

#FAQ

**How should I format my post?**

Follow the posting guidelines listed on the new post screen so your post is properly tagged and/or flair'd.  If it is not, Santa will be leaving coal in your stocking.

**What can I post here?**

+ Your code, in full or snippets
+ Your Github repository for AoC solutions
+ Questions how to solve a particularly trying puzzle
    + Please post whatever code you've tried first, if any
+ Blog posts and news articles about AoC

**How do I format code?**

Use [reddit's Markdown syntax](/cw70q).  Inline code can be surrounded with \``backticks`\` or entire code blocks posted with four (or more) spaces to start each line.

    public static void main() {
        # just like this!
    }

#Are you enjoying AoC?

Code should be fun, because otherwise it's just a job.  If you'd like to support Advent of Code, please share it with all your friends, even the ones that are just learning to code!  AoC is a fun, non-threatening way to work at your own pace to figure out how to apply problem-solving first, *then* work within a language's constraints.

If you *really* want to show your appreciation, donations are always appreciated.  Any instances of currency will go to, in no particular order:

+ Server maintenance (hosting, bandwidth, etc.)
+ Bribes to Santa
+ Beer and sushi
+ Paper bags for /u/topaz2078 to breathe into so he doesn't hyperventilate onto another plane of (non-)existence

Thank you very much, and enjoy your month of code!
